	<p id="Bio"> I have been a big fan of Captain America and Spiderman all my life. Peter Parker reminds me of myself with his geeky attitude and intelligence. Captain America is my motivation to never give up and stride to succeed. Both of them symbolize America's willpower and strength. They both relate to everyone's lives in overcoming the obstacles faced. Spiderman is our friendly neighborhood hero and Captain America was just a kid from Brooklyn. Both men have heart and can be considered my favorite comic book characters.</p>
